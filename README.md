# Integration 9A — SPARQL Query Suite

Follow the learner-facing integration guide on the AISPIRE course site.

**Deliverables:**

1. Implement `q1()` through `q8()` in `queries.py` per each docstring. Together the eight queries must exercise SELECT / CONSTRUCT / ASK / FILTER / OPTIONAL / ORDER BY / LIMIT.
2. Fill in `learner_notes.md` with a one-sentence intent and a first-5-row snapshot per query.
3. Open a PR with `learner_notes.md` rendered (or linked) in the description.

`load_dataset.py` is complete — bring up Fuseki, run it once, then `pytest tests/ -v`.

Local run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
docker compose up -d
python load_dataset.py
pytest tests/ -v
```
